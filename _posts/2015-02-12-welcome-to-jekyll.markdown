# break up with your girlfriend cuz i'm bored 
-----------
hello, _bitches_ it's me Greg, back at it again.
This time, I'm coming to you live from my new life in Oregon. 
For those of you who are just tuning in I'm a 27 year old computer geek, with a seriously ratchet side. 
Now, I'd love to promise that I have a _glam_ life, but I don't I work and study non stop, but I love it none the less. 
This is a place to just _grow_ we are gonna talk about whatever, and I'll post __whatever__ content I want, but I will share that the main point of this blog is to have MySpace vibes, mixed with my own personal asthetic. 
At this point, I hope I have captured your intrest and you're intrested in whatever it is that does go on here.. then bookmark this blog, and follow me on twitter to make sure you don't miss any updates!
